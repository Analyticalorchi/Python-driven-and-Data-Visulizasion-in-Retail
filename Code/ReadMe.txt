Python-Driven EDA & Data Visualization in Health
================================================

This project involves exploratory data analysis and visualizations for healthcare data. The code has been successfully tested on macOS and windows using Visual Studio Code.

Setup Instructions
------------------

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.12.2
- Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code with Jupyter extension
- Required Python libraries (listed below)

Required Libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy

Dataset:
Ensure you have the healthcare_dataset.csv file in the same directory as the code.

For Mac Users:
--------------

1. Unzip the provided Code.zip file: Double-click the zip file to extract its contents.

2. Open Terminal: Press Cmd + Space, type "Terminal", and press Enter.

3. Navigate to the project directory: Use the cd command to change to the directory where you extracted the files.

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook or open VS Code:

- For Jupyter Notebook: In the terminal, run: jupyter notebook
- For VS Code: Type code . in the terminal to open VS Code in the current directory.


5. Open the notebook:

- In Jupyter: Click on Code.ipynb in the Jupyter interface.
- In VS Code: Find and open Code.ipynb in the file explorer.


6. Update the dataset path if necessary.
Run the cells: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.

For Windows Users:
------------------
1. Unzip the provided Code.zip file: Right-click the zip file and select "Extract All".

2. Open Command Prompt: Press Win + R, type "cmd", and press Enter.

3. Navigate to the project directory: Use the cd command to change to the directory where you extracted the files.

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook or open VS Code:

- For Jupyter Notebook: In the command prompt, run: jupyter notebook
- For VS Code: Type code . in the command prompt to open VS Code in the current directory.


5. Open the notebook:

- In Jupyter: Click on Code.ipynb in the Jupyter interface.
- In VS Code: Find and open Code.ipynb in the file explorer.


6. Update the dataset path if necessary.

7. Run the cells: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.

Sample Data
-----------
A small sample of the data is included in the file 'healthcare_dataset.csv' for testing purposes. This sample allows you to run the code and see the output without using the full dataset.
